                    <p>I sketched out some ideas for a simplistic, cute character with a slightly non-humanoid look so that the rigging and animation would be uncomplicated.<br>The sketches on the right were done by me.</p>

            <h3>Environment Sketches</h3>
            <p>Our film has 4 major environments: home, a school classroom, a graduation room, and work. I drew each of these environments and included props that may be added in the background, such as office supplies and bedroom toys.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Storyboard</h3>
            <p>After developing a general story for our film, I was tasked to create the storyboard of the film. I kept in mind camera framing, the space that the characters and objects were taking up, and posing.<br><br>All boards were drawn on Clip Studio Paint.</p>

            <h3>Animation</h3>
            <p>Using Autodesk Maya, I animated 2 major scenes in Monster: “Walking to Work” and “work” (the entire section). I also animated the camera movements.</p>

        <div class="mini-headers">Reflection</div>
        <div class="monster-reflection">
            <p>Along with learning hard skills such as Autodesk Maya, I learned how to work and communicate with a team. Since this project took a full semester to complete, I learned how to boost my teammates strengths and how to find and take advantage of my own. I offered to do work that I was interested in knowledgeable in, such as the animation and storyboard drawings.</p>
            <p><br>If I were to redo this project, I would work on making my animations smoother. Some parts were a bit too choppy and I think that with more practice, they could look more natural and appealing.</p>
