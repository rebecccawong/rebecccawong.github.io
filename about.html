            <div class="about-body">
                As a fourth year SFU student with focuses in creative media and graphic design, I love exploring new ways to push design in fun and eye-catching ways. I have over 3 years of professional experience. Some places I have worked at include Fraser Health Authority, Douglas College, and BC Liquor Distribution Branch.
            </div>
            <div class="about-body">
                Aside from designing, I love reading, watching, and participating in all things from the animated film world. I once got the chance to take a 6-week 2d animation class taught by Jay Jackson, a legendary Disney animator! I love to watch (and re-watch) my favourite animated films, and have a large collection of animated art books that’s growing to this day.

            <div class="about-body">
                I also read, go to concerts, grow my vinyl record collection, and explore Vancouver’s cutest cafes!
