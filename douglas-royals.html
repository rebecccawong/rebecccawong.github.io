                            Promotional media was needed for various social media such as Twitter and Instagram. Our goal was to feature many student athletes to boost engagement and shares for our posts. We also wanted key information such as the dates and location of the championships to be clearly visible.

                            The event was based on the live action and animated movie, “Space Jam”. For promotional material, I challenged myself to recreate the Space Jam logo with the recreation department’s branding colours and event name, “Royals Rumble”. I worked in in both Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

                            I created an animated GIF of the logo in After Effects for video content. The small yellow circles are constantly rotating, giving the image visual interest, and the scaling letters draw attention to the name of the event.</p>

                            The first draft of the logo is almost identical to the Space Jam logo. It was good, but it didn’t represent basketball or the event enough.</p>

                            Draft 2 included a 3v3 basketball type, as well as the R looking like a basketball. The orange of the R, although it represented basketball in the logo better, was ultimately scrapped as it was too similar to the pink and yellow surrounding it.</p>

                            Draft 3 and 4 were experiments in exaggerating different aspects of the shapes. Draft 3 included a basketball net behind the hoops, but it made the silhouette of the logo too unclear. Draft 4 has an extended R, but looked too awkward and unbalanced.

                            I designed a poster to be printed and put around campus, and an adapted graphic to be posted as an Instagram story. The goal was to make the poster look like it was a basketball event without too much reading, and to have a simple, easily readable layout.

                            The first and second drafts of the poster were made of blocky text and less white space.<br><br>
                            Draft 1  had text that was made up of all medium or bold fonts. I realized that this was not only difficult to read, but it made the hierarchy harder to determine. An old version of the logo was used, but was changed to increase readability and accessibility. The logo was also scaled too big, with too little room on the left and right sides.<br><br>
                            Draft 2 softened many of the critique of the first draft. The text colour was changed from black to grey, and the grid block of text was improved. However, the text was still quite unreadable, and the margins, since the text was all different sizes, were inconsistent. In my final draft, I simplified the structure of the text immensely, using only two separated lines to give enough information.

                <p class="right-progress-text">
                    As this was one of my first projects working at Douglas college, I was still unfamiliar with how posters were typically designed and perceived, and how to use elements on a poster to  guide readers to see all the necessary information in a quick and easy way. I wanted to be creative with the layout of the text and use text sizes as a way to create hierarchy, After feedback, I realized that this way of designing, although interesting, was ultimately more difficult to read and didn’t reach the goal of allowing people to get a good overview of the event without too much effort.

                            Adapted for a smartphone, the sports bracket was designed for both men’s and women’s volleyball championships. The goal was to make the bracket easy to read and digest by using common bracket design features such as squares of logos and lines to connect the teams to the games they’d play. The challenge was to  still keep that familiarity, while making it accessible for phone sizes. The digital program guide was designed to be viewed on a mobile device.

                            Physical posters were designed to be put up around campus, promoting the event and showcasing some of the athletes participating. The athletes were in a awy to create a slight curve towards the right. This was to give the column of athletes more visual interest, and allow plenty of space for the left athletes holding out the volleyball.

                            The first draft was my initial take of the event: professional and clean, and dramatic. I focused on making clear hierarchy and creating a clear eyeline, from the date and logo, to the athletes, to the stream, then the location and social medias at the bottom. I also wanted to choose images that were all different from each other, showcased an equal number of athletes from the men’s and women’s teams, and took up a good amount of space on the page.

                            The second draft involved a change of the top right athlete due to team roster changes. I also changed all the text and icons to white to be cohesive with the PACWEST championships logo.<br><br>After feedback, the poster became more casual with a change to a simple line of text on the bottom bar, and the relocation and resizing of the date and location. The background was also changed to green to align with the athletic program’s branding colours.

The blank squares were filled during the event with stickers of the logos. The seed number was also requested to be featured with the team’s logo.

                            Double sided ID badges were designed to be worn by staff, athletes (left), and VIP members.

                            A program guide of the team’s rosters, brackets, and sponsors, was designed in Adobe InDesign. Keeping with the same theme of the poster, the backgrounds of the pages alternate between a light and dark sprayed deign. The program guide condenses each team into individual pages. It was a challenge to fit lots of information onto a single page. I didn't want to list of athletes to take up too much space or interfere too much with the rest of the page's hierarchy.

                    Use imagery. Show athletes, logos, patterns, use as much as necessary, because people generally want to see that over lots of text. Instagram was a great indicator of this, there was more engagement and comments on a post when athletes were included in the graphic, such as the event poster and final scores. I also expanded my knowledge in designing smaller merch, such as the ID badges. The badges were approxamitaly 4 x 6 inches, and I often overestimated how large I needed to make the text. I wasn't confident that the schedule informattion was readable, as it was condensed quite a bit into a small section. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see how readable the text was. I learned that using measuring tools in real life help greatly with determining how graphics will look on paper.
                    <br><br>
                    Creating graphics for a large events to be perceived by many requires a recognizable and consistent visual branding, involving colours, typography, and layout of elements. I practiced this heavily by creating many different graphics with the same elements, and still making them unique and not monotonous.

                            There are regularly new informational and attentional posters to design that revolve around the recreation facilities. The goal is to use the unique branding, which consists of the paint brush strokes as the header, the bold text font, and using different fonts of the same typeface family to indicate hierarchy. I also use iconography to give people an idea of the message before they read it fully. An example of a poster with no icons is the rules sign. I decided how to fit the 19 long rules in a limited sized poster. I made the header smaller than usual, because this poster would be printed on large paper, so the header would still be very visible if it was made much smaller.

                            I designed a purple bookmark to promote intramurals being hosted at Douglas College. Based on the designs of previous bookmarks, a bold, monochromatic colour scheme was chosen, and large text was used as the background. I chose to write “GO ROYALS GO” as a subtle way to encourage team spirit when reading the bookmark.
